# DataPhilly_StoredDataStories
Materials for the DataPhilly Fall Workshop: 'From Stored Data To Data Stories'

Greetings / Salvete / Schöne Grüße / Salutations / Pozdrowienia

### Before the Workshop ... ###  
* Required software  
* Required packages  
   * **R**: I'll be making use of **[pacman](https://github.com/trinker/pacman)**, a package management tool for R. This tool will load libraries and - *conveniently* - install those libraries that need to be installed. 
   * **Python**
* A few test cases (if these run successfully, you're good-to-go)
